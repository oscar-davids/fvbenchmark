# fvbenchmark

In order to evaluate continuous testing and accuracy in Fast verification, we need a standard dataset and evaluation script. 
The hash data folder contains 3090 of mpeg7-hash data generated by CPU and 3090 of mpeg7-hash data generated by GPU.
we can calculate the accuracy and false positive rate using the fvbenchmark.go script.

The current results are as follows.

````

true positive := 0.983495145631068, true negative := 1
false positive := 0, False negative := 0.01650485436893204

Accuracy := 0.9917475728155339
